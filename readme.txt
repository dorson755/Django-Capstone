Welcome to the Little Lemon Restaurant API project, where I've applied the principles and techniques learned throughout this course on backend development. Leveraging the robust Django REST Framework, I've crafted an API tailored specifically for managing table bookings at the Little Lemon restaurant.

Through a series of exercises, guided instructions, and reference materials provided within the course, I've embarked on a journey to demonstrate my proficiency in web development. The result is an API capable of handling various HTTP requests, including GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, seamlessly interfacing with Django models to maintain and update data within a MySQL database.

Join me as I showcase the culmination of my efforts in building a practical and efficient solution for the hospitality industry. Let's dive into the functionalities and intricacies of the Little Lemon Restaurant API.
